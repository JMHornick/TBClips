TBClips - Taskbar Clipboard Helper - Privacy Policy
  
TBClips does not directly access, collect, or transmit personal information (data that could be used to identify a person).  All data is stored locally in your Windows roaming user profile, and the fully qualified filename is displayed in the configuration UI.  TBClips does have the ability to run commands that you tell it to run, but it has no influence over those commands or what they do or collect (or do not collect).  TBClips itself is fully client-side, and does not collect any data.
